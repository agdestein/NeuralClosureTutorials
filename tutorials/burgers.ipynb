    "## Modeling exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "To get confident with modeling ODE right hand sides using machine learning,\n",
    "the following exercises can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Trajectory fitting (posterior loss function)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit a closure model using the posterior loss function.\n",
    "1. Investigate the effect of the parameter `n_unroll`. Try for example\n",
    "   `@time randloss(θ)` for `n_unroll = 10` and `n_unroll = 20`\n",
    "   (execute `randloss` once first to trigger compilation).\n",
    "1. Discuss the statement \"$L^\\text{prior}$ and $L^\\text{post}$ are almost the\n",
    "   same when `n_unroll = 1`\" with your neighbour. Are they exactly the same if\n",
    "   we use forward Euler ($u^{n + 1} = u^n + \\Delta t f(u^n)$) instead of RK4?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Naive neural closure model\n",
    "\n",
    "Recreate the CNN or FNO model without the additional square input channel\n",
    "(prior physical knowledge).\n",
    "The input should only have one singleton channel (pass the\n",
    "keyword argument `input_channels = (u -> u,)` to the constructor).\n",
    "Do you expect this version to perform better or worse than with a square\n",
    "channel?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Neural ODE (brute force right hand side)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe that, if we really wanted to, we could skip the term $f(\\bar{v})$\n",
    "   entirely, hoping that $m$ will be able to model it directly (in addition\n",
    "   to the commutator error). The resulting model is\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\bar{v}}{\\mathrm{d} t} = m(\\bar{v}, \\theta).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is known as a _Neural ODE_ (see Chen [^5]).\n",
    "1. Define a model that predicts the _entire_ right hand side.\n",
    "   This can be done by using the following little \"hack\":\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create your model `m_entire_rhs, θ_entire_rhs = create_cnn(...)`\n",
    "   - Define the effective closure model\n",
    "     `m_effective(u, θ) = m_entire_rhs(u, θ) - dns(u; μ)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train the CNN or FNO for `m_effective`.\n",
    "   Is the model able to represent the solution correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Learning the discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a new instance of the CNN closure, called `cnn_linear` with parameters\n",
    "   `θ_cnn_linear`, which only has one convolutional layer.\n",
    "   This model should still add the square input channel.\n",
    "1. Observe that the simple Burgers DNS RHS $f_\\text{central}$ can actually\n",
    "   be expressed in its entirety using this model, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   f_\\text{central}(u) = \\mathop{\\text{CNN}}(u, \\theta).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - What is the kernel radius?\n",
    "   - Should there still be a nonlinear activation function?\n",
    "   - What is the exact expression for the model weights and bias?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Improve\" the discretization $f_\\text{central}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Choose a kernel radius for `cnn_linear` that is larger than the\n",
    "     one of `f_central`.\n",
    "   - Train the model.\n",
    "   - What does the resulting kernel stencil (`Array(θ_cnn_linear)`) look like?\n",
    "     Does it resemble the one of `f_central`?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe that if we really wanted to, we could do the same for the more\n",
    "   complicated Burgers right hand side $f_\\text{shock}$. Some extra\n",
    "   difficulties in this version of $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It contains an absolute value (in the numerical viscosity)\n",
    "   - It contains cross terms $u_n u_{n + 1}$ (instead of element-wise squares\n",
    "     $u_n^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "   If we use a CNN with two layers (instead of one) and with\n",
    "   $\\sigma(x) = \\mathop{\\text{relu}}(x) = \\max(0, x)$ as an activation\n",
    "   function between the two layers, then the absolute value can be written\n",
    "   as the sum of two $\\mathop{\\text{relu}}$ functions with\n",
    "   $|x| = \\mathop{\\text{relu}}(x) + \\mathop{\\text{relu}}(-x)$.\n",
    "   Expressions on the same level without absolute value can also\n",
    "   be written as a sum of two $\\mathop{\\text{relu}}$ functions with\n",
    "   $x = \\mathop{\\text{relu}}(x) - \\mathop{\\text{relu}}(-x)$.\n",
    "   For the cross term, we just add it in the input channel layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a simple discretization $f_\\text{central}$ can be written as a one layer\n",
    "CNN. A better discretization $f_\\text{shock}$ can be written as a\n",
    "two layer CNN... What can we do with an $n$ layer CNN?\n",
